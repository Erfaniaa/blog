I guess you know my name by now. I started playing with code when I was 10 and I've been enchanted with software since then.  
I am super-passionate about **software architecture**, **leadership** and **startups**. I spend a lot of time on reading books and articles, watching tech talks and experimenting on these subjects.  
In my spare time, I'm mostly building software and contributing to open source softwares. I like to watch movies and series a lot. And last but not least, I try to keep blogging.

A brief history of my career so far.

* Currently, I'm a software engineer at [Divar](https://divar.ir)'s core team since May 2020 and team leader since Oct 2020.
* Formerly, I was working on **cloud storage** technologies and **databases** with different roles (software engineer, product manager and team leader) throught the years at [Zeerak](https://zeerak.ir) (a.k.a Cafe Bazaar Cloud) from March 2017 to May 2020.
* Working on a private cloud infrastructure by mostly developing and maintaing **Kubernetes** clusters at [Zeerak](https://zeerak.ir) (a.k.a Cafe Bazaar Cloud) from May 2016 to March 2017.
* As software engineer at Khak Co. from May 2014 to April 2016, I was mostly developing and maintaing software services.
